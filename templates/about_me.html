                <p class="sub_heading">Hello, I'm Adrienne Karnoski</p>
                <p class="about_blurb">After five years as an Advanced Radiographic Technician, I took the opportunity to explore other interests during my transition out of the Navy. I discovered an online course on software development and quickly developed an appreciation for the challenge of solving problemsout that pushed me out of my comfort-zone. My initial interest in programming grew to something I was truly passionate about, so I made the decision to make a career change.</p>
                <p class="about_blurb">From books to online resources, I used everything I could get my hands on to build websites: researching practices such as source control and responsive web design. Using the knowledge I had gained, I was accepted into Code Fellows, a Seattle-based, in-person coding academy, and relocated to Washington for the duration of my course.</p>
                <p class="about_blurb">While at Code Fellows I was immersed in a hands-on learning experience. After builing a strong foundation in website development, I continued my learning through an intensive, advanced-level course, specializing in Python.</p>
